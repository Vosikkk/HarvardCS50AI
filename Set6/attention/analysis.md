# Analysis

## Layer 1, Head 11

This attention head focuses primarily on the end of the sentence—specifically, the period. It observes the relationships between all the words within the sentence, but pays the most attention to how the words come together to form a logical conclusion. The period is a crucial element for this head to understand the final meaning of the sentence. In the first sentence, it also focuses on "turned down" and "passed through", highlighting their role in driving the action and movement before reaching the end.

Example Sentences:
- We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small [MASK].
- She [MASK] to step aside and enter through the main gate.

## Layer 11, Head 6

This attention head displays uniform attention across all words in the sentence. It doesn’t prioritize specific words but rather distributes attention evenly across the entire sentence, capturing a more holistic understanding of the content.

Example Sentences:
- She picked up a book and [MASK] to read it silently.
- We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small [MASK].
